    <p>The concept of white privilege is difficult for me to admit because acknowledging it means that I didn’t have to work as hard as others to get where I’m at. But what’s really happening is my insecurity getting in the way of showing compassion. I do this as a dad when I ignore or downplay my kids being afraid of the dark or being shy at school. I do this as a husband when my wife tells me how difficult it is to have a frank conversation with her boss at work. It makes me unapproachable and cold. And certainly nothing like Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>What would happen if I leaned in and acknowledged my obvious advantages instead of dismissing the disadvantages of others?</strong></p>
<p>I’d probably be compelled to act instead of think. To look outward instead of inward. I’d probably have to reckon with the responsibility I have to serve the less fortunate.</p>
<p>I think in 2020, the majority of white Americans are well-intentioned. We don’t deny the privilege to keep others down, we deny it to make ourselves feel better about our own weaknesses.</p>
<p>I want to use this moment in time to think less about myself and more about the ones we as Christians are called to love and serve. And either I can keep pretending I don’t know who that is or I can pick up the baton that we’ve been handed as a people of God and start running.</p>
