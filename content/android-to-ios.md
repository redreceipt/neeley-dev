Title: Android to iOS, An Experiment

It’s going to come as a shock to most people when they get a blue bubble text from me. I’ve been an Android user since the beginning. My first smart phone was the original Motorola Droid with the sliding keyboard. While I was most likely drawn to being anti-establishment in the beginning, what kept me around was Google’s endless curiosity and pursuit of technology on the fringes. It’s in their DNA to push the boundary of what is possible. The rapid iteration of exciting tech has kept me involved in their ecosystem.

What some would consider inconsistency and unreliability, I’ve always seen as a necessary component of challenging the status quo and I’m happy to be apart. I don’t see myself switching sides any time soon.

iOS on the other hand is compelling in my opinion for a very different reason. I’ve always been a fan of Apple’s products. The intuitive user experience and cohesiveness of the entire suite of devices is unmatched. The uncompromising quality has changed the world in ways that can’t be measured. And it takes uncanny insight to know what people want before they know themselves and Steve Jobs was the best. I’ve always recommended iOS to others and will continue to do so.

So while iOS is more polished, Android has always been the more exciting choice to me. But as I’ve gotten older, my priorities are changing. Recently I read a quote on Twitter that has me thinking:

> I use iOS because it helps me focus less on the technology and more on what I do with it.

I always considered myself a minimalist. You can ask my wife. I eat the exact same thing for breakfast and lunch every single day. I have three pairs of shoes that I wear. A pair of flip flops, and pair of athletic shoes, and a pair of slightly less athletic shoes for date night. I would wear the same pair jeans every day for eternity if Amber would let me. So I like consistency and not clogging up my brain with too many pointless decisions (as I see them).

_Except for tech._

I love experimenting with the latest hardware. I’ll sit for an hour browsing app stores for various tools, download them all, and then evaluate to see which ones I like best. I read the “What’s New” section when I have available updates. It’s this curiosity that has kept me firmly planted within Google’s sandbox.

But I want to see how the other half live. If Apple can help me focus less on the tech and more on everything else, and I believe it can, then I’ll give it shot.

My plan is not to go through and download all my Android apps onto the iPhone but instead to leave it bare, use the Apple provided apps as they were intended, and fill in with other apps as needed. But not in excess. I plan to document my experience and the things I find easier and as well as the things that are more difficult. I am well versed in both worlds so I should have no problem remaining objective.

I’ll post later with the things I like, the things I miss, and the verdict.
