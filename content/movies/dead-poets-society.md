Dead Poets Society

It was honestly kinda slow and boring. Acting was dull and unbelievable. The climax and tragedy didn't match the situation, seemed a bit over the top.

However, the message and takeaway of the movie was worth watching the whole thing for. It encourages doing what you love and living every moment to the fullest. Something that is so easily lost these days.

And it made me want to read poetry. Very weird. I liked the movie.
