Hi I'm Michael.

My life is way better than I deserve. A little over 10 years ago, Jesus radically changed me by extending grace to a selfish, lost kid in high school. I try every day to reflect the price he paid for me by showing that love to other people. Most of the time I fall short, but the ride is worth it.

I married my dream girl and have three kids. We live in Greenville, SC with family on both sides and, as a result, have all the free babysitting we could ask for. My wife and I both graduated from [Clemson](https://www.clemson.edu). Go Tigers üêÖ! Most Saturdays in the fall, you'll find us on the couch or at the game watching football. I love snowboarding, wakeboarding, really anything on a board. And I recently started MMA classes with Stephen ‚Äú[Wonderboy](https://youtu.be/ilBENf9qQvE)‚Äù Thompson üò¨.

At work, I'm a software developer for [Differential](https://www.differential.com). Love my job. We make digital products for lots of different companies. There's always something exciting to learn and work on. I use Javascript at work for pretty much everything: [frontend](https://reactjs.org), [backend](https://nodejs.org/en/), [app development](https://reactnative.dev). And at night I try to use Python to do everything I can possibly can, [even if there's a better alternative‚Ä¶](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

I'm pretty simple when it comes to gear and tools. I use [Vim](https://www.vim.org) for code, [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) for the blog, all the generic Apple software tools for everything else (Safari, Mail, Reminders, etc‚Ä¶) all on a pretty sweet 16" MacBook Pro. Love [Slack](https://slack.com) and [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) for work stuff.

As far as social media goes, I mainly stick to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micneeley14). Facebook is too noisy and I don't take enough good pictures to warrant Instagram. Resume is on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micneeley14/) if you want to connect. And for the super nerds, my [dotfiles](https://github.com/redreceipt/dotfiles) are on Github, as are all my other projects.

If you've made it this far, we're now best friends. Drop a line on any of the social links above. Thanks for stopping by!
