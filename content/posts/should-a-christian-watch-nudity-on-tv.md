Title: Should A Christian Watch Nudity on TV
Date: 2021-02-04
Status: draft

I've gone back and forth on this personally a few times.
[talk about why I stopped and why I felt it was ok to start back]

[wrong for the viewer?]

[intent matters, porn comes with lustful intent]
[watch and not lust?]
[simply admiring beauty?]

Is it possible that when I'm telling myself there's no lust involved, I'm fooling myself? When there's a flash on screen, why would I need "capture the thought" if it's not harmful? Can I really pretend that no matter how brief the scene, my mind doesn't give it a little bit of extra attention to forcefully ignore it? But ok, let's assume you _can_ see nudity on screen and think nothing about it. That leads me to ask other questions.

[is public nudity wrong? Harmful?]
[eating meat in front of a vegetarian]
[drinking around alcoholics]

[wrong for the person on screen?]
[aware and intentional, sinful to reveal nakedness, we are supporting their sin]

[unaware or naive nudity, victimized, we have the obligation to protect, not exploit]
