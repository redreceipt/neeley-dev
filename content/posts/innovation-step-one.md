Today we tried something new. Very different and very new. And it went so well. This is huge because I lead a team of brilliant, skeptics.

Not sure what was different about the approach. The idea wasn't mine, the execution wasn't done by me, and the feedback was most encouraging and critique most helpful when it didn't come from me.

There was one thing I did a lot ofâ€¦

**_Ask questions._**

I asked anyone who would indulge me for five minutes from the highest ranking staff member in our church down to the lowest ranking casual volunteer. Nothing was close-handed. Everything was open for discussion. And at the end of the day, we came away with some really great tweaks to an already great idea.

Conclusions:

- Identify the goal.
- Shut your mouth.
- Ask questions.
- Give away the credit.
