★★★

This book is a very good read for anyone that wants to make a difference and either doesn’t feel qualified or has been discouraged in the past. It paints a picture of world changers that go against every stereotype we’ve come to know. You don’t have to be a risk taker. You don’t have to be a child prodigy. There is no max age. In fact it does a great job of proving why so many of these false assumptions are often disadvantages.

It describes how someone can influence leadership effectively and even gives sound advice for raising children to be free thinkers. At times it can be a bit boring, simply because he gives _so_ much data to back up his claims. If you’re the type that likes a book to present the facts before drawing conclusions, you’ll probably enjoy how thorough he was. I was ready for it to end about 70% of the way through but still very much enjoyed it.

Whether you’re looking for inspiration to get the ball the rolling on your next big idea or feeling like you have good insights but aren’t being heard at work, this book is definitely for you.
