I've heard about this book from lots of friends recently, so I figured it was time to read it myself. And it did not disappoint. I had read Power of Habit by Duhigg awhile back. This book takes the science from that book and makes it way more practical. He uses many illustrations from true stories and makes it relate to many different circumstances. I took something from every chapter and constantly had ideas on how to improve my life.

One example, I've tried to learn a foreign language for years using the Duolingo app. Great app, super easy to use, but I can't ever stick with it. So using tactics from this book, I've paired it with another bad habit of mine, too much Twitter. Now I can only look at Twitter if I've done at least one lesson in Duolingo that day. So far I'm on a 14-day streak, I'm better at Spanish, and Twitter usage is way down.

Another bad habit of mine is going to bed late, making it difficult to wake up early. Taking inspiration and advice from the book, I'm simply going to take the TV out of our room and (pretty much) problem solved.

Highly recommend the book if you have good habits you want to start and bad habits you want to break. You _will_ get something out of it, guaranteed.
