★★★★

A very challenging look at our culture and the ways that we all play a part. It starts off by showing that the church is flawed but we can have hope. Despite all the ugliness, it's still standing 2000 years later. Jesus said he would build it and so the fight is worth it.

Jon then goes on to describe our toxic American culture and how we can counter balance it. Things like battling workaholism with rest, contempt with honor, desires with fasting, and many others.

It was challenging and caused a lot of self reflection. Even convinced me to send some unsolicited encouragement to someone on social media I typically roll my eyes at. Definitely recommend the book to anyone bored with typical American Christianity and is hungry for a breakthrough.
