There’s so much gold in this book it’s hard to summarize and pick out the most impactful thing to me. I like to think of myself as a simple person but reading this book made me realize so many areas that I still waste time and energy.

At its core, it helps you see what’s important and what’s not and how to effectively pursue the former. If you feel like you are always tired or busy or out of time in the day, this is the book for you. I could probably read this book every year and pick out something valuable to work on. Very inspiring. Not many books I would recommend more.

A must read.
