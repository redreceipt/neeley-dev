Every time I read something about Theodore Roosevelt, I’m blown away by the sheer will and resolve. What he lacked in natural intelligence or athletic ability, he constantly made up for with brute force, hard work and relentless activity. He seemingly didn’t have to try to do the right thing, he just knew. He had tremendous integrity and makes me wish we had leaders today of the same caliber.

He inspires me to work hard and do something great.
