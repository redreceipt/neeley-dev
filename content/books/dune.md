★★★★

I don't usually read fiction. And by usually I mean never. But this one came recommended and seemed to be a classic.

The book was fantastic.

It was easily the most epic story I've ever read. The scale of the universe that Herbert described was unlike anything else. It was very, very long and much of the time I was hoping to be done soon but I never considered stopping. It's clearly a story that has influenced many others over the years and I'm glad I read it.

It is a deep dive on leadership and in a very believable narrative, demonstrates how someone is able to capture the hearts of men and inspire others to follow. Controlling emotions and overcoming fear are the major themes throughout. I admired so many of the characters and loved seeing them make and execute plans for the good of their people and their families.

Highly recommend.
